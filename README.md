This project presents an innovative and efficient solution for crop irrigation scheduling by integrating a Machine Learning (ML) model with Arduino technology. The ML model, developed using a dataset from Kaggle, leverages classification techniques, including Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting, to predict optimal irrigation schedules based on inputs such as crop type, temperature, humidity, and moisture. Unlike traditional IF-ELSE or CASE-based approaches, this ML model accommodates multiple inputs, enhancing its precision and economic viability. Additionally, the project explores data analysis, visualizations, and comparisons of classification models, demonstrating the advantages of the hybrid approach combining Decision Trees and Gradient Boosting. Overall, this application offers a promising tool for precision agriculture, optimizing resource allocation and crop yield while emphasizing interpretability and performance.
